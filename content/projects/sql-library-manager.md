Web application that'll include pages to list, add, update, and delete books. A more intuitive way to manage the library's collection of books.  
<br/>
Created with node.js, express and SQL ORM Sequelize using middleware, routes, pug templates and SQLite database to accomplish a full functional and dynamic website.  
<br/>
User begins at the landing page with a list of library's collection of books where:  
<br/>
- Create a new book. (with validation errors)  
<br/>
- Look for detailed info of each book.  
<br/>
- Update the book. (with validation errors)
<br/>
- Delete the book.  
<br/>
Always taking care of not found pages, not results for a book search or for internal server errors.
