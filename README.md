# Nuxt-Folio

## My portfolio made with nuxt.js

---

Responsive static site to expose myself and using it as showcase for my projects. Made with [**Nuxt.js**](https://github.com/nuxt), module [**nuxt-content**](https://github.com/nuxt/content) for manage projects contents, module [**nuxt/prismic**](https://prismic.nuxtjs.org/) working with [**Prismic API**](https://prismic.io/) and styled with [**taillwind css**](https://tailwindcss.com/).
